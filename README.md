HTML, CSS, AND Git: Refactoring

This project was refactoring the code for the marketing company. 
I refactored the code semantics to make it easier for someone who 
Is looking at the code for the first time to understand it as well as to improve 
Accessibility of the website for their potential clients.
I learned to structure the code with proper semantics such as header, sections with class titles, 
and alts were added to aid in accessibility. 
When all the div.â€™s were replaced with proper semantics, all elements of the website 
functioned correctly.
