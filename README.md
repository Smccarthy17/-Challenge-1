HORISEON REFACTOR & ACCESSIBILITY
# HTML, CSS, AND Git: Refactoring & Accessibility

This project was refactoring the code for the marketing company. 
I refactored the code semantics to make it easier for someone who 
Is looking at the code for the first time to understand it as well as to improve 
Accessibility of the website for their potential clients.
I learned to structure the code with proper semantics such as header, sections with class titles, 
and alts were added to aid in accessibility. 
When all the div.â€™s were replaced with proper semantics, all elements of the website functioned correctly. 

THE FOLLOWING TECHNOLOGIES WERE USED: HTML, CSS, and GIT

USER STORY: 
As a user I want to be able to easily navigate the website, clearly see what each section is representing, and have it be accessible. 


Acceptance Criteria:
Given I want clients and potential clients to be able to easily navigate the website and to be able to gain accessibilty if needed. 
When I click on the navigation bar headings they will take to the designated area. 
When I resize the page 
Then I am presented with a responsive layout tht adapts to my viewpoint.
