HORISEON REFACTOR & ACCESSIBILITY
# HTML, CSS, AND Git: Refactoring & Accessibility

This project was refactoring the code for the marketing company. 
I refactored the code semantics to make it easier for someone who 
Is looking at the code for the first time to understand it as well as to improve 
Accessibility of the website for their potential clients.
I learned to structure the code with proper semantics such as header, sections with class titles, 
and alts were added to aid in accessibility. 
When all the div.â€™s were replaced with proper semantics, all elements of the website functioned correctly. 

THE FOLLOWING TECHNOLOGIES WERE USED: HTML, CSS, and GIT

User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines

Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
